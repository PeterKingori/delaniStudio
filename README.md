## Description
This is a landing page for a fictional website design and development studio. It showcases the services offered and previous projects undertaken by the company. There is also a contact form for potential clients to send a message to the company. The link to the live site is https://peterkingori.github.io/DelaniStudio/
## Setup/Installation Requirements
All the code used is available for viewing on this repository. You can copy and paste it to your own folder then run the html file on your browser. Alternatively, you can also fork this repository then clone the documents. 
## Known Bugs
Integration with the Mailchimp API is not yet working. There should be social media icons at the bottom of the page but they are currently not displaying because the latest commit information has failed to load onto Github.
## Technologies Used
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery.
